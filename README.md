1. videometadata is a python3 utility that lists video metadata.
2. This is based on ffmpeg. ffmpeg can be installed from here https://www.ffmpeg.org/
3. VIDEOFILEPATH variable  has the folder path containing the video files.
4. allowedfilexts function controls the file to anlaysed via extensions. At times a typical folder might have anudo and video files.
5. Tested with Python version 3.6
While i will try to fix reported bugs, it would be difficult to make any commitment on timelines.
